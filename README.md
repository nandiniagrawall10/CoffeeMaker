â˜• Coffee Machine Project

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Project! This simple yet functional Python program simulates a coffee machine that serves delicious espresso, latte, and cappuccino. It's a great way to learn how to manage resources, handle user input, and work with conditional statements.

ðŸš€ Features

Interactive Menu: The machine prompts users to choose between espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

Resource Management: The machine checks if there are enough ingredients to make the selected drink.

Transaction Handling: It calculates the cost, processes payments, and returns the appropriate change.

Reporting: At any time, you can check the status of the machine's resources.

Power Off: Maintainers can turn off the machine with a secret command.

ðŸ›  How It Works

Start the Machine: The program starts by asking, "What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):"

Make Your Choice: The user selects their drink, and the machine checks if enough resources are available.

Payment: If resources are sufficient, the user is prompted to insert coins. The machine calculates the total amount, checks if it's enough, and returns the change.

Enjoy Your Drink: Once everything is in order, the drink is served, and the resources are updated.

Check the Report: Enter "report" at the prompt to see the remaining water, milk, coffee, and money.

Turn Off: If you're the maintainer, type "off" to power down the machine.
